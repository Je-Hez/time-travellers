    <h1>Well when the word time is said, it is nomaly put to three things, "monsters, witchs, and time travels" well we are going to talk about time travels in ths part</h1>
  	<h1>"IS TIME TRAVEL REAL"By Ailsa Harvey. Well sience says time travel is possible but probably not in the way you are thinking</h1>
  	<h2>We all have one question in our brain, Is time travel possible? And the short answer is yes. and you may be doing it right now. Hurtling into the future at the impressive rate of one second per micro-second</h2>
  	<p1>You're pretty much always moving through time at the same speed, whether you're watchimg paint dry or wishing you had more hours to vist with freinds form out of tow. But this isn't the the kind of time travel thats captivated countless science fiction writers, or spurred a genre so extensive that WIKIPEDIA lists over 400 titles in the category of movies about time travel, In rafranchises like "Doctor Who, Star Trek, Back to the future, etc." characters climb into some wild vehicle to blast into the past or spin into the future. Once the characters have travelled through time, they grapple with what happens if you change the past or present based on the information from the future(which the idea of the parallel universes or alternate timelines)</p1></br>
  	<p1>Although many people are fascinated by the idea of changing the past or seeing the future before it's due, no person has ever demostrated the kind of back-and-forth. Time travel seen in science fiction or proposed method of sending a person through significant periods of time that wouldn't destory them on the way as physicist stephen hawking pointed out in his book"black holed and baby universes"(banram, 1994), "The evidence we have that time travel is not possible, and never will be, is that we have"</p1>
    <p1>we had that all. But it is said by some people that when we unlock full brain composion we can achive greater things which including time travel but they also say that they are some people or things that are blocking us from getting that.</p1></br>
